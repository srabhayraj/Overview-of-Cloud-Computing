# Overview of Cloud Computing


## What is a Cloud
  Cloud is collection of computing resources which are accessed through the internet.
  
## What is Cloud Computing
  Cloud Computing is the use of software and hardware to provide services like storage, VM, servers and many more over the network. Or we can say Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing servicesâ€”including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence over the Internet.
  
## Benefits of using Cloud Computing
  -	Enables access to cloud resources.
  -	Enables access to cloud services.
  -	Builds virtualization concept.
  -	Provide the option pay as you use.

## Why Cloud Computing
  -	Traditional Computing companies had to spent a lot of money and time on infrastructure, hardware and other operational aspects.
  -	By using cloud computing all these troubleshoots are managed by cloud service provider, so we just had to focus on our business.
  -	Cloud enables the developers to get their applications to market quickly.
  -	As long as internet connection is on user can access their required application.
  -	Even there are some applications which run offline.
  -	Cloud based services are ideal for business with growing and fluctuating bandwidth demand.
  -	As it is flexible you can easily scale down the cloud capacity as per requirement.
  -	Cloud Computing reduces the cost of managing and maintaining IT system.
  -	Cloud services providers offer resources and using these resources rather than expensive system and equipment you can save money.

## What is a Cloud Provider
  A cloud service provider is a third-party company offering a cloud-based platform, infrastructure, application or storage services.
  
## What are the advantages of Cloud Computing
  - Pay as you go (or consumption-based payment) - you are paying only for what you are using. No upfront payments and payment stops when resources are no longer used.
  - Scalable - resources are scaled down or up based on demand
  - Less Cost
  - 24 x 7 Availability	
  - Security
  - Reliability

## Types of Cloud Services or Cloud Computing Service Models
  <b>IaaS</b> - Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a form of cloud computing that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Eg., AWS {S3, EC2}, GCE (Google Compute Engine), Microsoft Azure. </br>
  <b>PaaS</b> - Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) is a type of cloud computing offering in which the service provider delivers a platform to clients, enabling them to develop, run, and manage business applications without the need to build and maintain the infrastructure. Eg., AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Lambda </br>
  <b>SaaS</b> - Software as a service (SaaS) is a cloud computing model in which a third-party provider host the applications and makes them available to customers over the Internet. Eg., Google Workspace, Dropbox, Cisco WebEx </br>
